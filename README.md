# Image Similarity Comparison with Fuzzy Logic

## Overview
This project implements a fuzzy logic-based approach to comparing images. It provides a flexible framework for assessing the similarity between two images, considering various features such as intensity difference and edge similarity.

## Features
- **Fuzzy Logic-Based Comparison**: Utilizes fuzzy logic to handle the inherent uncertainty and imprecision in image comparison tasks.
- **Customizable Input Variables**: Allows users to define input variables relevant to image comparison, such as intensity difference and edge similarity.
- **Flexible Rule-based System**: Enables users to define rules that determine the overall similarity between images based on the combination of input variables.
- **Context-Aware Design**: While the provided example focuses on intensity difference and edge similarity, the framework can be extended to incorporate other features based on specific requirements.
- **Usage Scenarios**: Suitable for a variety of applications including content-based image retrieval, duplicate image detection, and quality assessment in image processing.

## Usage
1. **Input Images**: Provide paths to two images that you want to compare.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to compute the similarity between the provided images.
3. **View Results**: The script will output a similarity value indicating the degree of similarity between the images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: numpy, scikit-fuzzy, Pillow

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy scikit-fuzzy Pillow

Feel free to further customize it according to your project's specific details and requirements!
